  description: PWM wings child node
  properties:
    pwms:
      required: true
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        Reference to an array of PWM instance. (phandle + output number, from 0 to 3)

        Design the four servos used (up to 4 !)

    label:
      type: string
      description: |
        Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
        application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.

    period:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        The duration of a PWM cycle (use NRF macros to get the correct format !)

    min-pulse:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        Minimal value of the output pulse for the PWM servo. Generally, this is around 1 millisec.

        This value shall correspond to the minimal angle wanted.

    max-pulse:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        Maximal value of the output pulse for the PWM servo. Generally, this is around 2 millisecs.

        This shall correspond to the maximum angle wanted.

    max-angle:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        The maximal area that can be covered, as an unsigned integer :

        This value assume to be centered arround 0 and is calculated as MAX - MIN in absolute degrees.
        For our servo, this is :
          90 - (-90) -> 180Â°
