compatible: "pwm-servo"

  properties:
    pwms:
      required: true
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        Reference to a PWM instance. (phandle + output number, from 0 to 3)

        The period field is used by the set_brightness function of the LED API.
        Its value should at least be greater that 100 nanoseconds (for a full
        brigtness granularity) and lesser than 50 milliseconds (average visual
        persistence time of the human eye). Typical values for the PWM period
        are 10 or 20 milliseconds.

    label:
      type: string
      description: |
        Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
        application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
        (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.

    min-pulse:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        Minimal value of the output pulse for the PWM servo. Generally, this is around 1 millisec.

    max-pulse:
      required: false
      type: int
      description: |
        Maximal value of the output pulse for the PWM servo. Generally, this is around 2 millisec.
